# example for feature (e.g. "workers panel")

## instead of:

"create workers panel"

## dod would be:

### workers panel is done when:
- workers render from workers.json dynamically
- hire action updates state correctly
- cost scaling works per spec
- insufficient funds state handled
- tooltips show correct stats
- unit tests cover hire logic
- panel responsive at 320px–1440px
- no console errors
- manually tested with 6–8 worker types


### common mistakes
- making dod too vague ("code is clean" ← meaningless)
- making dod too heavy for the team size
- changing dod per sprint
- confusing acceptance criteria with dod
